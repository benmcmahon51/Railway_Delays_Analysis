# Railway Delays Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing high-speed railway data to identify attributes that impact train ride arrival and departure delays. The analysis is conducted using Python in a Jupyter notebook as part of a [CodeCademy Python For Data Analysis Lab](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/practice/analyzing-high-speed-railways-with-python)

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the train schedule information and weather conditions to determine factors affecting train ride delays.

## Data

The project utilizes 28 CSV files for analysis. The key datasets are:

* `railway_delays_2020_01_1.csv` to `railway_delays_2020_01_27.csv`: These files contain train schedule information.
* `weather.csv`: This file contains corresponding weather conditions.

## Methodology

The analysis involves the following methodologies:
* Python loops for iterating through data.
* If/elif statements to handle various conditions.
* List comprehensions for efficient data manipulation.
* Vertical concatenation to merge data from multiple CSV files.
* Data cleaning and standardization to prepare the data for analysis.
* Data aggregation to summarize and extract insights.

For a detailed walkthrough of the analysis, refer to the Jupyter notebook available in this repository.
